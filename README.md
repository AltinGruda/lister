You can create a list, and celecting your preferred channels instantly populates your personalized playlist with the latest videos from those sources.

When you click at one of the lists you created, you'll see a list of video cards, each representing a YouTube video. These cards display the video's thumbnail, title, channel name, and publication date. You can also see a default video card with placeholder content.

When you click on a video card, a modal window pops up, showcasing the selected video in a larger view. The modal includes an embedded YouTube video player that adjusts its size to fit the modal's dimensions. You can watch the video right within the modal without leaving the page.

**Tech used:** React, React Query, Tailwind, Nodejs, Mongodb

This app is a dynamic web application crafted using modern technologies including React, a powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It seamlessly integrates with Node.js and Mongodb to handle data processing and communication with external APIs. The user interface is further enhanced by leveraging Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process. Also, the app uses React Query to manage data fetching and caching, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. It also utilizes external libraries like Day.js for handling relative time formatting and a custom Navbar for navigation.

## Optimizations
Due to unexpected Google API pricing considerations, the project had to be put on hold. The decision to discontinue the project was made in light of the financial implications of using Google APIs. However, had the project continued, exciting enhancements were plannel like implementing advanced features such as video filtering, seamless infinite scrolling to explore a wider array of videos, and introducing more engaging functionalities.
